    CODE CHALLENGE: Implement the expectation maximization algorithm for soft k-means clustering.
    Input: Integers k and m, followed by a stiffness parameter Î², followed by a set of points
    Data in m-dimensional space.
    Output: A set Centers consisting of k points (centers) resulting from applying the
    expectation maximization algorithm for soft k-means clustering. Select the first k points
    from Data as the first centers for the algorithm and run the algorithm for 100 E-steps
    and 100 M-steps. Results should be accurate up to three decimal places.
